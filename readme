#  TCGA copy number vs ethnicity in lung cancer

Summary of Health Disparities Grant

Goals:

1) Contributions to Science
   a)Community-based translational research model to address cancer disparites
     1)Black men more likely to die from lung and prostate cancer
     2)Black women have lower incidence of breast cancer than white 
             women but 41% greater chance of dying from the disease

2)Identification of novel targets in lung cancer
    a)Have already identified new targets that are being evaluated as potential
      novel drug targets to treat lung cancer (γ-catenin, Dishevelled, PRMT1.)
3)Advances in translational lung cancer research
4)Development of Collaborations to Impact Research Breakthroughs

Specific Aims:

1)Leverage an existing cohort of lung cancer tissue stratified
by Black/AA men and NHW men to validate the expression
levels of PRMT1 and PRMT6 in lung cancer tissue.2)
2)Identify the mechanism(s) that contribute to the formation of
PRMT1/PRMT6 heteromer complex driving lung cancer in
Black/AA men.
3)Evaluate the role of PRMT1/PRMT6 heteromer complex in
both in vivo and patient-derived xenograft organoid (PDXO)
models.

Innovation:
1)Drugs targeting the interface of the PRMT1/PRMT6 heterodimer rather than PRMT1 or PRMT6 dimer individually,
  since targeting PRMT1 or PMRT6 individually may be comparatively toxic
